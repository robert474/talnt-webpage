## About

Data Center TALNT connects experienced project managers, MEP engineers, QA/QC inspectors, commissioning agents, schedulers, and construction managers with employers building and operating America's critical infrastructure. We serve all 50 U.S. states with concentrated expertise in the top data center markets: Northern Virginia (Ashburn), Dallas-Fort Worth, Phoenix, Chicago, Silicon Valley, Atlanta, Portland, Columbus, Reno, and Salt Lake City.

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Veteran Recruiters (The Veteran Advantage)
- Our recruiters bring years of specialized experience in technical recruiting
- 50+ years combined recruiting experience across 20+ markets
- They come from companies like Apple, Rackspace, Aerotek, and Duo Security
- They can vet a commissioning agent's technical skills in a 15-minute call
- When they call a VP of Construction, that call gets returned — because there's a track record behind it

### 2. Exclusive Talent Database (The Database Advantage)
- A growing database of recruiting data with every interview logged, indexed, and searchable
- 70% of candidates in our network are passive — not on job boards
- Every candidate has detailed interview notes, technical assessments, verified project history, and performance feedback
- We track: certifications (PMP, CxA, PE, NETA, OSHA), tier/MW experience, compensation history, geographic preferences, availability timelines
- Deep candidate coverage in every top data center market

### 3. Speed & Execution (How We Move Fast)
- Dramatically faster time-to-fill vs. the industry average of 126 days — contract placements in days, direct-hire in weeks
- Source: The Birm Group — Data Center Construction Boom & Hiring Surge in 2026
- Step 1: Live Talent Pipeline — pre-screened professionals ready before you call
- Step 2: Industry-Specialist Recruiters — technical vetting in 15 minutes, not weeks
- Step 3: 48-Hour First Shortlist — screened and reference-checked candidates in 2 business days
- Step 4: Streamlined Hiring Process — we handle scheduling, feedback, counteroffers, and onboarding
- Result: Months of schedule risk eliminated on every hire

### 4. Technology
- Jobs posted and distributed in minutes (automated, not manual)
- Instant candidate matching against our growing database
- Same-day screening and interview scheduling
- Pre-verified candidates with references on file
- Streamlined offers and digital onboarding

## The Cost of Slow Hiring
- $15,000+ per week estimated cost of an unfilled PM or QA/QC inspector position
- 340,000 unfilled construction positions projected by BLS for end of 2026
- 82% of construction firms report difficulty filling positions (AGC data)
- 23,000 experienced workers retiring annually from the industry
